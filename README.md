## **SUMMARY**
Solar flares are energetic eruptive events that occur on the Sun's surface and are largely responsible for adverse space weather near Earth. 
These events can cause great harm to the Earth and space-based technologies we so heavily depend on.
They are known to drag sattelites out of orbit, prevent radio communications and generate surges in our power grids, utlimately damaging them. 
In recent years, great progress has been made in understanding the physics of solar flars, though accurately predicting these events remains mysterious. 
As solar flares are thought to originate in active regions, the dynamics of the latter may ascertain vital information to the process involves in such events. 
In this study, the rotation of a flaring sunspot was observed in hopes of corellating its dynamics to the flare phenomenon. 
Prior to the flare event, the sunspot was seen to reverse its rotation and suddenly accelerate. Upon flaring, the sunspot stopped rotating. This pattern may be observable in many sunspots and may be indicative of the arrival of a flare.
