## **SUMMARY**
Solar flares are energetic eruptive events that occur on the Suns surface and are largely 
responsible for adverse space weather near Earth. These events can cause great harm to the 
Earth and space-based technologies we so heavily depend on. They are known to drag 
satellites out of orbit, prevent radio communications and generate surges in our power grids, 
ultimately damaging them. In recent years, great progress has been made in understanding the 
physics of solar flares, though accurately predicting these events remains mysterious. As 
solar flares are thought to originate in active regions, the dynamics of the latter may ascertain 
vital information to the processes involved in such events. In this study, the rotation of a 
flaring sunspot was observed in hopes of correlating its dynamics to the flare phenomenon.
Prior to the flare event, the sunspot was seen to reverse its rotation and suddenly accelerate. 
Upon flaring, the sunspot stopped rotating. This pattern of rotation may be observable in 
many other sunspots and may be indicative of the arrival of a flare.


The torsional motions of sunspot AR 2939 were measured in detail for a period of 144 hours 
around a flare event thought to originate within this active region. The project made use of 
the high polling rates of the SDO/HMI instrument in order to yield complete and detailed 
measurements of the rotation. A Python programme was written to handle the substantial data 
set that came from the high polling rates used throughout the analysis. It was found that the
sunspot umbra undergoes a reversal of rotation, and a harsh acceleration of its angular motion 
prior to the flare event. The flare occurrence seemingly halted the rotation of the umbra 
instantly. Although the umbra displayed strong motion, the penumbra was unaffected by the 
flare occurrence, and held a steady counter clockwise motion throughout the analysis, with 
only a small decrease in its angular motion thereafter the event. This differential rotation of 
the umbra and penumbra are yet to be understood correctly. It may constitute some straining 
mechanic on the flux tubes within a sunspot. This - when coupled with the rapid independent
umbral acceleration - may inject sufficient magnetic energy stresses into the corona for an 
eruptive event to occur.
